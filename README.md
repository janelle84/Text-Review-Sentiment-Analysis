**Machine Learning** Foundations: A Ground-Up Approach @ stanCode
> [!NOTE]
> For this project, I built a machine learning model right from scratch. I did not use any of the ready-made machine learning libraries or frameworks, in order to get to grips with the basics of machine learning. I wanted to understand every little detail about how you train and test these models. So, I handled almost everything manually, from designing the model to processing the data. This hands-on approach helped me learn a lot about the algorithms and techniques that are at the heart of machine learning. It was all about diving deep into the fundamentals and seeing what makes these models tick.
